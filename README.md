# Expert-System-using-backward-chaining
Develop a Restaurant Decision Assistant using simple backward chaining in Python. The assistant will help users decide on a suitable restaurant based on their preferences and dietary restrictions. The system will use backward chaining to infer the user's desired type of cuisine and dietary requirements by asking a series of questions.

Based on the cuisine and dietary requirements select the restaurant from the dataset The Dataset of restaurants is:

The Rules are:

1. If the user prefers spicy food, the system will suggest restaurants that offer cuisines like Indian, Thai, or Mexican, known for their spicy dishes.

2. If the user does not prefer spicy food, the system will suggest restaurants that serve milder cuisines such as Italian or American.

3. If the user follows a vegetarian diet, the system will recommend restaurants with a variety of vegetarian options, ensuring a satisfying dining experience.

4. If the user follows a vegan diet, the system will prioritize restaurants that offer vegan-friendly menus to cater to their dietary preferences.

5. If the user has specific dietary restrictions or allergies, the system will consider those limitations and suggest restaurants with suitable menu items, such as gluten-free or lactose-free options.

6. Based on the user's preference for a casual or fine-dining experience, the system will recommend restaurants that match the desired ambiance and style of dining.


7. The system may also consider the user's location to suggest nearby restaurants, making dining choices more convenient and accessible.

8. After considering all the user's responses, the system will provide a final restaurant recommendation that aligns with their inferred preferences and dietary needs.
